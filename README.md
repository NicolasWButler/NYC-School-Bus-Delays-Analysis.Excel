# 🚌 NYC School Bus Delays Analysis (Excel)

📊 **Project Overview**  
This project analyses **school bus breakdowns and delays in New York City** using Excel.  
The dataset covers reported breakdowns, delays, and reasons across boroughs, bus companies, and days of the week.  

The project demonstrates Excel skills in:  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** (removing errors, standardising formats)  
- **Exploratory analysis** across multiple dimensions (by company, borough, reason, day)  
- **Pivot tables, aggregations, and filtering** to identify trends  
- **Data storytelling** — linking operational data to real-world transport challenges

## ❓ Key Questions & Findings

### 1. What are the most common reasons for bus delays?  
- **Traffic** and **Mechanical Issues** were the leading causes.  
- Weather-related delays appeared less frequently but were significant in winter months.

### 2. Which bus companies and boroughs face the highest number of delays?  
- Certain companies reported disproportionately high delays.  
- **The Bronx** and **Brooklyn** showed higher delay counts compared to Staten Island, suggesting borough-specific challenges such as congestion.

### 3. Do delays follow patterns across weekdays?  
- **Mondays and Fridays** showed slightly higher delays compared to midweek, suggesting traffic flow and school schedule effects.  
- Wednesdays were typically smoother with fewer disruptions.

### 4. How does raw data compare to the cleaned dataset?  
- Raw data contained duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, and some missing fields.  
- Cleaning improved readability and enabled structured analysis (e.g., pivot tables by borough).

## 🚀 Key Insights

- **Traffic congestion** is the single largest contributor to school bus delays.  
- Certain **bus companies** face disproportionately high delays, hinting at operational inefficiencies.  
- **Borough-specific issues** (e.g., Bronx/Brooklyn congestion) play a key role in reliability.  
- Delays cluster more heavily on **Mondays and Fridays**, suggesting targeted planning could reduce disruption.  
- Data cleaning was critical: the raw dataset was inconsistent and messy, highlighting the importance of preprocessing.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone this repo or download the files.  
2. Open `.xlsx` files in Excel (or Google Sheets if compatible).  
3. Use pivot tables/filters to explore breakdowns by reason, borough, and company.  
4. Compare **raw** vs **cleaned** datasets to understand preprocessing impact.
