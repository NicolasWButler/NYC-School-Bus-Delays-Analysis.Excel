# 🚌 NYC School Bus Delays Analysis (Excel)

📊 **Project Overview**  
This project analyses **school bus breakdowns and delays in New York City** using Excel.  
The dataset covers reported breakdowns, delays, and reasons across boroughs, bus companies, and days of the week.  

The project demonstrates Excel skills in:  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** (removing errors, standardising formats)  
- **Exploratory analysis** across multiple dimensions (by company, borough, reason, day)  
- **Pivot tables, aggregations, and filtering** to identify trends  
- **Data storytelling** — linking operational data to real-world transport challenges

## ❓ Key Questions & Findings

### 1. Scenario and Project Context  
The project scenario simulates being hired by the **New York Division of Transportation** to analyse school bus breakdowns and delays. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies and recommend improvements.

### 2. What does the raw (messy) dataset look like?  
- The **raw data** contained duplicates, inconsistent naming of bus companies, missing fields, and formatting errors.  
- This made it difficult to directly analyse, requiring careful cleaning before insights could be extracted.

### 3. How does the cleaned dataset improve analysis?  
- The **cleaned data** removed duplicates, corrected inconsistent formats, and standardised bus company names.  
- This enabled structured analysis with pivot tables across boroughs, reasons, and weekdays.

### 4. What are the most common reasons for bus delays?  
- **Heavy Traffic** was the single largest contributor to delays.  
- **Mechanical issues** (e.g., flat tyres, buses failing to start) accounted for over **10,000 incidents**.  
- Weather-related problems, while less frequent, caused spikes in winter months.

### 5. Which companies and boroughs face the most delays?  
- Certain companies, such as **Safely Transportation**, had disproportionately high delays.  
- Borough-level analysis revealed **The Bronx** and **Brooklyn** as the most delay-prone areas, reflecting congestion and higher population density.  
- Staten Island consistently showed the lowest delay counts.

### 6. Do delays follow weekday patterns?  
- **Mondays** experienced the highest volume of delays.  
- **Fridays** were the smoothest, with fewer incidents, reflecting lighter traffic and early school dismissals.  
- Midweek delays were moderate but still significant.

## 🚀 Key Insights

- **Traffic congestion** is the single largest contributor to school bus delays.  
- Certain **bus companies** face recurring operational inefficiencies.  
- **The Bronx and Brooklyn** stand out as hotspots for delays.  
- **Delays peak on Mondays** and are lowest on Fridays, reflecting broader traffic patterns.  
- **Cleaning the dataset** was essential to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
