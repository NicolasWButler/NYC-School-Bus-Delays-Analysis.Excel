# 🚌 NYC School Bus Delays Analysis (Excel)

📊 **Project Overview**  
This project analyses **school bus breakdowns and delays in New York City** using Excel.  
The dataset covers reported breakdowns, delays, and reasons across boroughs, bus companies, and days of the week.  

The project demonstrates Excel skills in:  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** (removing errors, standardising formats)  
- **Exploratory analysis** across multiple dimensions (by company, borough, reason, day)  
- **Pivot tables, aggregations, and filtering** to identify trends  
- **Data storytelling** — linking operational data to real-world transport challenges

## ❓ Key Questions & Findings

### 1. Scenario and Project Context  
The project scenario simulates being hired by the **New York Division of Transportation** to analyse school bus breakdowns and delays. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies and recommend improvements.

### 2. What are the most common reasons for bus delays?  
- **Heavy Traffic** and **Mechanical Problems** were the leading causes.  
- Mechanical issues such as buses not starting or flat tyres accounted for over **10,000 breakdowns**.  
- Traffic delays made up the bulk of incidents, with **176,000+ cases of buses running late**.

### 3. Which bus companies and boroughs face the highest number of delays?  
- Some companies, such as **Safely Transportation**, had the longest average delay times.  
- Borough analysis showed **The Bronx** and **Brooklyn** had consistently higher delays compared to Staten Island, reflecting congestion and population density.

---

### 4. Do delays follow patterns across weekdays?  
- **Mondays** had the highest delay counts, while **Fridays** showed the lowest.  
- This trend reflects traffic patterns: higher congestion at the start of the week and less commuting activity at the end.

### 5. How does raw data compare to the cleaned dataset?  
- **Raw data** contained duplicates, inconsistent formats, and missing entries.  
- **Cleaned data** improved readability, standardised company names, and enabled pivot-table analysis by borough, day, and reason.

## 🚀 Key Insights

- **Traffic congestion** is the single largest contributor to school bus delays.  
- Certain **bus companies** experience disproportionately high delays, suggesting operational inefficiencies.  
- **Borough-specific issues** such as congestion in the Bronx and Brooklyn reduce reliability.  
- **Delays peak on Mondays** and fall on Fridays, highlighting traffic’s influence on school transport.  
- **Cleaning data** was essential: the raw dataset’s errors made it difficult to analyse without preprocessing.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone this repo or download the files.  
2. Open `.xlsx` files in Excel (or Google Sheets if compatible).  
3. Explore pivot tables/filters to analyse breakdowns by reason, borough, and company.  
4. Compare **raw** vs **cleaned** datasets to understand the value of preprocessing.  
5. View included **screenshots** for a quick overview without needing to download.
